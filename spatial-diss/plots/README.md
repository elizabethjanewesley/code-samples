These scripts produce data visualizations, including descriptive plots, mapping of spatial distributions, and plots for evaluating and interpreting model output. The following R packages are used:

- `bayesplot` for visualizing the Bayesian models created using `brms`
- `scico` for perceptually uniform and colorblind safe color palettes
- `tidybayes` for incorporating Bayesian models in a tidydata workflow
- `patchwork` for combining separate ggplots
