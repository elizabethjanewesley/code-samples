# Code samples

This repository contains samples of code used for my PhD and Master's research. My dissertation is titled **Climate, environment, neighborhood, & health: Pediatric asthma in Kansas City** and investigates how the spatial and temporal variation of acute pediatric asthma relates to the complex interactions between social, environmental, and climatic systems. My thesis is titled **Effects of Greenspace Configuration on the Urban Heat Island: A Study of the Kansas City Metropolitan Area** and investigates how greenspace abundance and pattern influence the surface urban heat island.

## Climate, environment, neighborhood, & health: Pediatric asthma in Kansas City

### Neighborhood effects on pediatric asthma

We took a Bayesian approach to modeling the interactions between race, income, greenspace, and PM<sub>2.5</sub>. Code samples include:

1. Data processing
  - Using Google Earth Engine to calculate [land surface temperature (LST)](spatial-diss/daily_LST_tracts.R) and [fractional vegetation (Fr)](spatial-diss/daily_Fr_tracts.R) for each census tract
  - Merging datasets and calculating summary measures for each census tract

2. Models
  - Running Bayesian models, including specifying priors for the parameters
  
3. Plots
  - Data visualization including mapping spatial variation and evaluating model output

4. Tables
  - Creating LaTeX tables
